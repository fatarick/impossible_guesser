# Impossible Guesser (Or Random Guesser)
It's a simple game-script at python that generated an random number until 999 Billion and "AI" Guess it. If "AI" guessed it wrong you should to guess it but you have infinity chances until you write "exit" or "Exit" :)

# Known Bugs
When you write "Exit" or "exit" it writes "Try Again" and then exits the game.
