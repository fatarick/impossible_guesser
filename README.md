# Impossible Guesser (Or Random Guesser)
It's a simple game-script at python that generated a random decimal number from 1 until 999 Billion and "AI" Guess it. If "AI" guessed it wrong you should to guess it but you have infinity chances until you write "exit" or "Exit" :)

# PreHell

This is a practice for the "Hell" and "VeryHotHell" versions of the game with decimal numbers. Main and MinusPlus are with normal numbers, so its easier.
